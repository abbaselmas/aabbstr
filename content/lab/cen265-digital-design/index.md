## Announcements

- There won't be any face-to-face lab sessions.
- Every week or biweekly you are responsible to deliver homework(s) and/or projects.
- There won't be midterm and final exam.
- All of the grading will be from homeworks and projects.
- All the announcements will be maden from this webpage (https://aa.bbs.tr/lab/cen265-digital-design/)
- You have to learn how to use git and github. Homework submissions will be trough github classroom.
- Every assignment (experiment) will be published in Github Classroom Assignment section.
