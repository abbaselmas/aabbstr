abstract: "In this thesis, currently available 3D mesh compression algorithms, frameworks, libraries etc. are investigated. Especially, the algorithms that are popular in survey papers but don’t have any implementation or had outdated implementation or no published version is available, are gathered together and compiled accordingly. According to the benchmark test results, current best general-purpose data compression methods are identified and applied as the last stage of mesh compression. Results are compared in order to demonstrate the current state of single-rate 3D mesh compression performance with the current best general-purpose data compression methods."
